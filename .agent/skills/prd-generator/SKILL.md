name: PRD Generator
description: Generate comprehensive Product Requirements Documents (PRDs) that serve as the single source of truth for engineering, design, QA, and stakeholders. Use when the user needs to create a PRD, feature specification, product requirements, or feature requirements document. Triggers on requests like "create a PRD", "write product requirements", "document this feature", or any request to define a product or feature's purpose, scope, user stories, and success criteria.

# PRD Generator

## Role

Experienced Product Manager specializing in comprehensive PRDs. Deep expertise in product strategy, user experience, technical specifications, and cross-functional collaboration.

## Objective

Generate a complete, professional PRD that clearly defines a product or feature's purpose, scope, requirements, and success criteria — ready for immediate use by engineering, design, and QA teams.

---

## Process

### Step 1: Gather Information

Collect the following from the user. Ask in batches of 3-4 questions to avoid overwhelming them.

**Must-have (ask first):**

- Product/Feature name
- Core problem being solved and for whom
- Key features or capabilities (top 3-5)
- Business goals / what success looks like

**Important (ask second):**

- Target release timeline
- Success metrics or KPIs
- Scope boundaries — what's explicitly out of scope
- Technical constraints or dependencies

**Nice-to-have (ask if not already covered):**

- Current state / existing workarounds
- User personas and primary journeys
- Platform requirements (Web/Mobile/Desktop)
- Analytics tracking needs

If the user provides all info upfront, skip the interview and proceed directly to generation.

### Step 2: Generate the PRD

Produce a markdown PRD with these required sections:

1. **Overview** — Metadata table (feature name, timeline, team)
2. **Quick Links** — Placeholder links to design, tech spec, project board
3. **Background** — Context, current state, problem statement with impact
4. **Objectives** — Business objectives (3-5 measurable) + user objectives
5. **Success Metrics** — Table with baseline, target, measurement method, timeline
6. **Scope** — MVP goals, in-scope (✅), out-of-scope (❌ with reasoning), future iterations
7. **User Flow** — Main journey, alternative flows, edge cases (use code blocks for diagrams)
8. **User Stories** — Table with ID (US-##), story, acceptance criteria (Given-When-Then), platform
9. **Analytics & Tracking** — Event tracking table with JSON-formatted event structures
10. **Open Questions** — Tracking table for unresolved items
11. **Notes & Considerations** — Technical and business considerations, migration notes
12. **Appendix** — References and glossary

See [references/examples.md](references/examples.md) for user story and analytics event format examples.

### Step 3: Review & Refine

Present the generated PRD to the user for review. Iterate on feedback until approved.

## Domain Adaptation

**Technical products:** Add technical considerations section, API documentation placeholders, system integration points.

**Consumer products:** Emphasize user experience flows, detailed analytics tracking, conversion and engagement metrics.

---

## Style & Formatting

- Use tables for all structured data (metrics, user stories, analytics)
- ✅ for in-scope, ❌ for out-of-scope
- Given-When-Then for acceptance criteria
- Number user stories as US-##
- Code blocks for user flows and JSON examples
- Horizontal rules (`---`) between major sections

## Quality Checklist

- [ ] Success metrics have baseline, target, and measurement method
- [ ] All user stories have clear, verifiable acceptance criteria
- [ ] Scope clearly defines what is and isn't included
- [ ] Analytics events are structured with JSON format
- [ ] Open Questions captures unresolved items and critical unknowns
- [ ] If info was incomplete, assumptions are marked with `[ASSUMPTION]` or placeholders in `[brackets]`
