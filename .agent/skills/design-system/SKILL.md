name: Design System Generator
description: Create comprehensive design system documentation including components, design tokens, and UI patterns. Use when the user needs to define visual identity, component libraries, token systems, or pattern guidelines. Triggers on requests like "create a design system", "define the visual language", "document components", or "design tokens".

# Design System Generator

## Role

Senior Design Systems Architect. Creates developer-friendly design system documentation that serves as the single source of truth for consistent UI implementation across teams.

## Objective

Generate design system documentation covering **design tokens** (colors, typography, spacing), **component specifications** (anatomy, props, states, accessibility), and **UI patterns** (layout
compositions, interaction flows). Output must be implementable by developers.

---

## Process

### Step 1: Process Inputs & Interview

**Scenario A: Existing Brand / Specs**
Read the provided materials. Identify:

- Existing brand colors, fonts, and visual identity
- Framework in use (React, Vue, Web Components, etc.)
- Existing component library (if any)

**Scenario B: Standalone Request (No Specs)**
Interview the user to gather context:

- **Vibe**: Describe the look and feel in 3 words (e.g., "modern, clean, bold")
- **Framework**: Target framework (React/Vue/Svelte) and CSS approach (Tailwind, CSS Modules, styled-components)?
- **Base System**: Starting from an existing system (Material, shadcn, Ant Design) or fully custom?
- **Dark Mode**: Required?
- **Accessibility**: WCAG AA or AAA target?

### Step 2: Generate Documentation

Use the templates in [references/template.md](references/template.md). Select the right template per element type:

| Element Type | Template               | When to Use                                              |
|--------------|------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| Component    | Component Template     | Buttons, inputs, cards, modals, etc.                     |
| Token Set    | Design Tokens Template | Colors, typography, spacing, shadows, etc.               |
| Pattern      | Pattern Template       | Form layouts, navigation patterns, data display patterns |

**Dual output — ALWAYS produce both files:**

1. `docs/design-system.md` — Human-friendly markdown for designers and developers.
2. `docs/design-system.yaml` — Machine-readable YAML for AI agents and tooling.

> **CRITICAL:** Both files MUST contain exactly the same content. The YAML is a structured mirror of the markdown, not a summary. Every token, component, variant, and prop in the `.md` must appear in
> the `.yaml` and vice versa.

**Key generation rules:**

- **Semantic token names**: Use `color-text-primary` not `color-gray-900`.
- **Accessibility**: Every interactive component must include ARIA, keyboard nav, and screen reader guidance.
- **Code examples**: Provide in the target framework (React + TypeScript by default).
- **Do's and Don'ts**: Include for every component.
- **Cross-references**: Link related components and patterns.

### Step 3: Review

Present the documentation to the user.

- Verify token values match brand identity.
- Confirm component variants cover all use cases.
- Validate accessibility requirements.

## Quality Checklist

- [ ] Token naming is semantic and consistent
- [ ] All interactive components have accessibility guidance (ARIA, keyboard, screen reader)
- [ ] Code examples are syntactically correct and copy-pasteable
- [ ] Do's and Don'ts included for components
- [ ] Related components are cross-referenced
- [ ] `.md` and `.yaml` outputs have identical content (no drift)
