description: HEAVY complexity project kickoff — generates full documentation suite for enterprise, platform, regulated, or multi-team projects.

# Project Kickoff Workflow (HEAVY)

This workflow is for **enterprise, platform, regulated, or multi-team projects** where predictability and scale are critical. Each feature is independently deployable and documentation is versioned.

## When to Use HEAVY

Use this workflow if ANY of the following apply:

- Multi-team project
- External API consumers
- Regulated or compliance-heavy domain
- Data model changes affecting multiple services
- Long-lived platform with multiple stakeholders

# Global Artifacts (Once Per Project)

These are created **once** and governed centrally.

## Step 1: PRD (Signed-Off)

1. **Read**: Load `skills/prd-generator/SKILL.md` for interview guidance.
2. **Interview**: Follow the skill's data-gathering process to collect requirements, user stories, acceptance criteria, constraints, and dependencies.
3. **Confirm**: Require explicit sign-off before proceeding.
4. **Generate**: Execute the skill to produce the PRD.
5. **Approve**: Stop and wait for explicit user approval. Do NOT auto-proceed.

## Step 2: Functional Specification Document (FSD)

1. **Read**: Load `skills/fsd-generator/SKILL.md` for interview guidance.
2. **Interview**: Follow the skill's data-gathering process to collect detailed functional flows and business rules.
3. **Generate**: Execute the skill to produce `docs/features/[feature-name]/fsd.md`.
4. **Approve**: Stop and wait for explicit user approval. Do NOT auto-proceed.

## Step 3: Tech Stack & Architecture Decision

1. **Read**: Load `skills/tech-stack/SKILL.md` for interview guidance.
2. **Interview**: Follow the skill's data-gathering process to collect application type, team expertise, frontend/backend frameworks, database, auth strategy, hosting/infra, CI/CD, and third-party
   integrations.
3. **Confirm**: Summarize stack choices and trade-offs.
4. **Generate**: Execute the skill to produce `docs/tech-stack.md`.
5. **Approve**: Stop and wait for explicit user approval. Do NOT auto-proceed.

## Step 4: Design System

1. **Read**: Load `skills/design-system/SKILL.md` for interview guidance.
2. **Interview**: Follow the skill's data-gathering process to collect brand identity, colors, typography, component styles, and accessibility requirements.
3. **Confirm**: Summarize the design direction.
4. **Generate**: Execute the skill to produce the Design System.
5. **Approve**: Stop and wait for explicit user approval. Do NOT auto-proceed.

## Step 5: Core ERD  [Optional, ask user if they want to do this]

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Why this matters for HEAVY projects:**
> Skipping this step often leads to "data silos" where different features duplicate data inconsistently. A unified ERD is critical for reporting, analytics, and maintaining data integrity across a
> large system.

1. **Read**: Load `skills/erd-generator/SKILL.md` for interview guidance.
2. **Interview**: Follow the skill's data-gathering process to collect core entities, attributes, relationships, cardinalities, and constraints.
3. **Confirm**: Review entity diagram.
4. **Generate**: Execute the skill to produce `docs/erd/core-erd.md` with Mermaid ERD.
5. **Approve**: Stop and wait for explicit user approval. Do NOT auto-proceed.

## Step 6: Core API Standards & Contract Governance [Optional, ask user if they want to do this]

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Why this matters for HEAVY projects:**
> Inconsistent APIs are the #1 cause of "integration hell" in multi-team projects. Defining standards and contracts upfront allows frontend and backend teams to work independently without blocking
> each other.

1. **Interview**: Define platform-wide API conventions.
    * *Question*: "What are your standards for authentication, error handling, versioning, and rate limiting?"
2. **Document Standards**: Create `docs/api-standards.md` covering:
    - Auth flow (OAuth, JWT, API keys)
    - Error response format
    - Versioning strategy
    - Rate limiting policy
3. **Generate Contracts**:
    * **Objective**: Allow frontend and backend teams to work in parallel.
    * **Action**: Generate OpenAPI/Swagger specifications based on the FSD and Data Model.
    * **Output**: Create `docs/api/contracts/` containing the spec files (e.g., `openapi.yaml`).
4. **Approve**: Wait for explicit user approval. Do NOT auto-proceed after generating contracts.

# Per-Feature Artifacts (Repeat Per Feature)

These are created **for each feature or module**.

## Step 7: Feature PRD Addendum & PRD

1. **Read**: Load `skills/prd-generator/SKILL.md`, `skills/prd-generator/SKILL.md` for interview guidance.
2. **Context**: Read `docs/prd.md` to understand the current product state and constraints.
3. **Interview**: Follow the skill's data-gathering process, scoped to this specific feature.
4. **Generate**: Execute the skill to produce `docs/features/[feature-name]/prd-addendum.md`.
5. **Approve**: Stop and wait for explicit user approval. Do NOT auto-proceed.

## Step 8: Sprint Stories

1. **Read**: Load `skills/story-generator/SKILL.md` for guidance.
2. **Generate**: Execute the skill to break FSD into sprint-ready, estimated stories.
3. **Output**: Create a directory of individual story files at `docs/features/[feature-name]/stories/`.
    * Ensure each story is in its own markdown file (e.g., `VORA-001-login.md`).
4. **Approve**: Stop and wait for explicit user approval. Do NOT auto-proceed after generating fixes. If revisions are requested, generate them and then STOP again for approval.

## Step 9: Global Artifacts Integration

1. **Objective**: Merge feature-specific artifacts back into the core documentation to maintain a single **cohesive** source of truth (avoiding fragmentation).
2. **Refactor Global PRD**:
    * **Input**: Read `docs/features/[feature-name]/prd-addendum.md` and the current `docs/prd.md`.
    * **Action**: Integrate the new requirements and stories into the Global PRD.
    * **CRITICAL**: Do NOT just append the addendum as a new section. You must **REFACTOR** the Global PRD to weave the new feature seamlessly into the existing narrative and structure.
3. **Approve**: Wait for explicit user approval. Do NOT auto-proceed after refactoring.

# Completion

* Notify the user that all documents have been generated.
* Provide a summary of files created and their locations.
* Remind user that ERD changes are explicit and audited, and stories are written *after* FSD approval.
