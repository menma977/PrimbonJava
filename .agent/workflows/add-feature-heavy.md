# Add Feature Workflow (HEAVY)

This workflow is for adding new features or modules to an **enterprise, platform, regulated, or multi-team project**. It ensures consistent documentation standards for everything added post-kickoff.

## Step 1: Feature PRD Addendum & PRD

1. **Read**: Load `skills/prd-generator/SKILL.md` for interview guidance.
2. **Context**: Read `docs/prd.md` to understand the current product state and constraints.
3. **Interview**: Follow the skill's data-gathering process, scoped to this specific feature.
4. **Generate**: Execute the skill to produce `docs/features/[feature-name]/prd-addendum.md`.
5. **Approve**: Stop and wait for explicit user approval. Do NOT auto-proceed.

## Step 2: Sprint Stories

1. **Read**: Load `skills/story-generator/SKILL.md` for guidance.
2. **Generate**: Execute the skill to break FSD/Requirements into sprint-ready, estimated stories.
3. **Output**: Create a directory of individual story files at `docs/features/[feature-name]/stories/`.
    * Ensure each story is in its own markdown file (e.g., `VORA-001-login.md`).
4. **Approve**: Stop and wait for explicit user approval. Do NOT auto-proceed after generating fixes. If revisions are requested, generate them and then STOP again for approval.

## Step 3: Global Artifacts Integration

1. **Objective**: Merge feature-specific artifacts back into the core documentation to maintain a single **cohesive** source of truth (avoiding fragmentation).
2. **Refactor Global PRD**:
    * **Input**: Read `docs/features/[feature-name]/prd-addendum.md` and the current `docs/prd.md`.
    * **Action**: Integrate the new requirements and stories into the Global PRD.
    * **CRITICAL**: Do NOT just append the addendum as a new section. You must **REFACTOR** the Global PRD to weave the new feature seamlessly into the existing narrative and structure.
3. **Approve**: Wait for explicit user approval. Do NOT auto-proceed after refactoring.

# Completion

* Notify the user that feature documentation is complete.
* Provide a summary of files created and their locations.
* Remind user that stories are written *after* requirements approval.
